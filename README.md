Custom Wordpress theme!
Fictional U is a custom WordPress theme built from scratch. HTML was sliced up into necessary WordPress PHP files so the theme can be activated from the WP Admin menu. This theme features custom post types, custom feeds on the homepage, Google Maps API integration for campus locations, and the ability for guests to create an account for note taking in class. Users can also ‘like” specific professors from their user account. Fictional U also includes a custom site search that searches not only standard WordPress posts and pages, but also searches custom post types and serves results from the entire website.
